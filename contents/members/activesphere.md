The team at ActiveSphere loves to tinker with interesting technologies, making them work best for developers and businesses alike. They love solving problems with programming.

Besides client projects, the folks at ActiveSphere spend time [hacking](http://www.activesphere.com/hacks.html) utility tools and fun projects. They've worked with Golang, Erlang, Haskell, Python and more. They've also used React, Ruby, AngularJS, node.js, Typescript, D3.js, and GStreamer in various projects.
