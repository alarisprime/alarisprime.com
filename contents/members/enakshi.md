Enakshi is thankful for the existence of free music and secretly donates local organic farm produce to unsuspecting folks. 

She calls herself an interface designer and boasts of engaging with some amazing startups in the last one and half years in Bangalore, including [Compile](http://compile.com/), [GSViQ](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/gsviq/id1071669100?mt=8), [Dailyrounds](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/daily-rounds-clinical-cases/id1003799400?mt=8) and [Liv.ai](https://liv.ai/).

A graphic design graduate from National Institute of Design <abbr>(NID)</abbr>, Enakshi enjoys designing off her laptop nearly as much as staying up nights, study-sketching the human anatomy.
