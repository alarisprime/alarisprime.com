Enakshi is thankful for the existence of free music and secretly donates local organic farm produce to unsuspecting folks. 

She calls herself an Interface Designer. In the last one and half years in Bangalore, out of the start-ups she has engaged with, she boasts [Compile](http://compile.com/), [GSViQ](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/gsviq/id1071669100?mt=8), [Dailyrounds](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/daily-rounds-clinical-cases/id1003799400?mt=8) and [Liv.ai](https://liv.ai/). A graphic design graduate from National Institute of Design (NID), she enjoys designing off her laptop nearly as much as staying up nights, study-sketching the human anatomy.
