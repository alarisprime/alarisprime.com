				<p>Designing and developing responsive web is still a mystery for many teams. Through this workshop, you will learn to create a “Good Enough Design” system. The workshop includes exercises on conceptualizing a product idea, creating user flows, designing modular interfaces, to building a custom living style guide that works across devices – phones, tablets, desktops or TVs.</p>
				<p>Through smart choices we can speed up the design phase. Through a living style guide we can speed up the development. The style guide also helps to maintain and scale your web app without breaking your team’s brains.</p>
				<p>All this will help you to spend the energy – wasted on fights between your development and design teams – on making a better product.</p>
